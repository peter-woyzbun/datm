What is Datm?
=============

Datm is a graph-based, in-browser, data manipulation and visualization application. It's written in Python and uses the
django web framework. It allows users to:

* Create "projects" and add datasets to them (see :ref:`add-datasets` demo).
* Transform datasets using "manipulation sets" (similar to dplyr, see :ref:`transform-datasets` demo).
* Join two datasets (see :ref:`join-datasets` demo).


See the :doc:`tutorial` for an overview of Datm's features.
